# Mobile Apps

This page highlights issues Mobile App development teams need to know about open source code in their apps.

## Credits

Mobile apps that Power publishes must include 3rd party notices listing relevant open source license information. We usually make this available in a menu selection near the app's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy text, in a Settings or About menu. We call this _Credits_ whereas some apps list these as _Notices_, _Third Party Notices_, or _Open Source Credits_.

Development teams are responsible for identifying and crediting all open source software they use in the app development process. After you identify the open source software used to create your app, please work with the SDRB to get launch approval. This process may include including the proper Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Credits contents. Depending on your app, you may have additional disclosures to add. The SDRB will work wth the app team and/or the Legal department to ensure you have open source credits attributed properly and to ensure the credits are generated during the build process.
